I converted the work of Tim Arnold on Behance into a web page.
from this link here: https://www.behance.net/gallery/118034461/36-Days-of-Type-2021

This is not to steal his work as all design credits go to him.


My Process:
- Download all typography
- Use Adobe Illustrator to extract the scalable vector graphics format
- exported svg and uploaded to cloud
- Used Next JS to develop the Interface using Tailwind CSS.


This was made by me to test my frontend skills. and I was able to achieve this under 15 Hours same day. 

I would be updating the page as time goes on, fixing the responsiveness and some other parts. 

I am Olawale Samuel, a product designer and frontend developer.


Thanks for viewing this.
